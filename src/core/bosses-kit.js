//   part  = { id, dx, dy, w, h, hp, weak }  (dx, dy: centre offset from the boss's centre)

//   phase = { until, move, attacks, rate?, minions? }
//     until   the hp fraction at which this phase ends (the last is 0)
//     move    a boss move (boss-move.js MOVES); rate scales the pace (default 1)
//     attacks [{ pattern, every, from, p }]: every `every` s (shorter on harder levels) the part
//             `from` warns, then fires `pattern` with p = { count?, spread?, speed? } (speed is a
//             multiplier on the level's bullet speed)
//     minions [{ species, role, count, every, from }]: aliens launched from a part, flying at the
//             ship, each fighting as its species' role
//   y is the boss's resting centre; bottom the lowest edge of any part below that centre.
