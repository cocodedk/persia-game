// A level's weather (levels.js weatherOf) is drawn by its kind: each kind in WEATHER names the phase
// of the frame it falls in and the function that draws it. Rain and petals fall in the field, under
// what fights; stars, the moon, dawn and sunrise belong to the sky, so the mountains and the landmark cover them.
//   fadeWeather(w, t) -> k   w = { since: null } eases k from 0 up to 1 over FADE s from the first
//     frame the weather is drawn (it never stops within a world, and each level and retry has a view
//     of its own, so a world that has weather from its start fades it in too)
//   drawWeather(ctx, v, world, t, phase)   draws the world's weather if it falls in `phase` ('sky' or
//     'field'); view.js calls it at both places. A kind's function takes (ctx, k, t, quality, reduced,
//     age): the fade, the view's clock, the quality level, reduced motion, and the seconds since the
//     weather began, which only sunrise's climb reads
