// Dawn, the fifth kind of weather (levels.js weatherOf, ui/weather.js): low over the mountains the
// night sky the bake painted warms in flat horizontal bands, violet into rose into amber, thin at the
// top and fading up into the night; it is the bake's red glow (sky-bodies.js horizonGlow) coming to
// light. Drawn in the sky phase, before the parallax layers, so the mountains and the landmark stand
// in front of it. The first band starts just under the red moon's disc and the baked stars lie
// above it, so neither is ever tinted.
// Bands, not a gradient, like the sky's own pixel blocks: each is a fillRect across the screen,
// BAND tall, a whole number of PIXEL blocks, on the sky's grid. A band's alpha rises from 0 at TOP
// to 1 at FOOT, slowly at first so the upper sky stays night; from FOOT to the bottom of the screen
// the dawn is at full strength. Its colours are constants here, as the moon's and the stars' are
// (the look is not asked).
//   drawDawn(ctx, k, t, quality, reduced)   k 0..1 how far it has come in, scaling every band's alpha;
//     it has no motion and no sprite, so t, the quality and reduced motion change nothing (the voice
//     has named the dawn)
