// Sunrise, the sixth kind of weather (levels.js weatherOf, ui/weather.js): level 8's dawn warming the
// sky low over the mountains (dawn.js), and over it the sun, a small disc of pixel blocks that climbs
// out from behind the far mountains until about half of it shows, then stays. Drawn in the sky phase,
// before the parallax layers, so the mountains and the landmark stand in front of it and hide what is
// still below them. The moon and the baked stars lie above the dawn and stay as they were.
// The sun is drawn live, row by row, as fillRects: a block is BLOCK px (two PIXELs) and every rect is
// on the 8 px grid, so it climbs a whole block at a time. A near-white core in a pale gold, a gold
// rim, and a few faint rings of the same gold round it at low alpha. It stands opposite the moon,
// mirrored about the screen's middle, right of the landmark (the layer's centre). Its colours and
// place are constants here, as the moon's and dawn's are (the look is not asked); where it stands once
// risen is read against each level's far ridge.
//   drawSunrise(ctx, k, t, quality, reduced, age)   k 0..1 how far the weather has faded in, scaling
//     every alpha; age the seconds since the weather began (weather.js), the climb's clock. Under
//     reduced motion the sun stands at its height from the start; t and the quality change nothing
//     (the voice has named the sun)
