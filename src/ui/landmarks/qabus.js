// Gonbad-e Qabus at night, the parallax layer kind 'qabus' (parallax-shapes.js has the painter
// contract), painted in PIXEL-sized blocks (kit.js): in the middle the tomb tower of 1006, a tall
// cylinder of pale fired brick whose ten sharp flanges run from its foot to the roof, floodlit from
// below, under a cone of the same brick, a band of inscription under the roof and a plaque over the
// small pointed door (qabus-tower.js); the green mound it stands on with the steps up to the door,
// and round the mound a park of pines and cypresses with lamps (qabus-park.js); and on the plain to
// either side the town's low tiled roofs, their windows lit (qabus-town.js). The layer brings L.lit,
// L.ink, L.glow, L.lamp, L.brick, L.tile, L.tree, L.grass and L.roof (the town's tiles); the brick
// and its lamps are Yazd's (yazd-brick.js). Rows are counted from F, the plain the park stands on.
