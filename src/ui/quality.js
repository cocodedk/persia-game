// Auto quality. The game's loop hands sampleFrame the measured WORK time of every frame (core steps
// + fx + draw, performance.now() around them) and the rAF interval it ran in. Once a second (of
// intervals) both averages are judged:
//   drop to 0.5 (half the particle spawns via fx.density, no glow on the far parallax layer)
//     when the work averages above DROP_MS, or the interval above DROP_RATIO x the display's
//     base period, capped at DROP_CAP_MS (ruling R23: a GPU-bound Pi shows in the display's pace, not
//     in the CPU work; R49: the cap keeps a 40-odd fps renderer from passing while base sits at 20);
//   restore to 1 only when the work is below RESTORE_MS AND the interval below RESTORE_RATIO x base;
//   in between hold, so a frame cost sitting near one line never flickers.
// The interval alone is no measure of the work: a 60 Hz display pins it at 16.7 ms whatever the
// frame costs. The base period (M1) is the quickest 1 s average interval seen, so a 50 Hz display
// (20 ms) is judged against its own pace and can restore. It never goes below 60 Hz's period (the
// game ticks at 60: a 144 Hz display missing frames is no reason to drop), nor above 50 Hz's, the
// slowest display mode a kiosk runs: a renderer slow from its first second cannot pass for a slow
// display, and a 30 Hz display sits at half quality (accepted cost of R23). Pure: no clock of its own.
//   q = createQuality() -> { level, avg, interval, base, sum, isum, n, span }
//   level 1 | 0.5; avg and interval: the last window's mean work and mean interval (ms); base (ms)
